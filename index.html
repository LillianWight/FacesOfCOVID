                                <p>My dad died two days ago from COVID19. He died alone because the hospital restricted all visitors in order to contain the outbreak. My deepest regret was not saying bye to him when I brought him to the hospital. I thought it was going to be a “Take care, see you back home.”</p>

                            <p>I lost my best friend to Covid19 a few hours ago. Dr Frank Gabrin was an ER Doctor in NYC. He planned to go back to work when he recovered. It took only five days from the first sign of symptoms. He leaves a husband of less than one year behind. We are devastated.</p>

                            <p>A relative, Emily Coalson Stamets, called Ott “one of the smartest people I know.” Retired nurse Christiane Geisler, who worked with Ott, a social worker, at CrescentCare, said in an interview that she “never said 'no' to a client in need.”</p>
